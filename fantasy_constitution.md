## Article VIII Ownership expectations

### ยง 9.1 League Fee

Prior to the draft, team owners are expected to pay $20 with 100% of that funds going to earnings.

### ยง 9.2 Earnings

Earnings shall be distributed with 80% going to 1st place, 20% going to 2nd place.

## Article IX Amendments

- All rules not explicity written in this constitution shall be drafted by the league owner or commissioner for clarification.

- Prior to draft and after all team owners paid their fees, there will be a period for each team to propose amendment changes which shall be voted:

  - Head-to-Head if 2, non-numerical sections
  - Ranked choice voting if more than 2, non-numerical sections
  - Median value if any numerical value or ratio (a la )

- Rules created but not had a chance to be voted on by the league are not binded to this constituition. This will be enforced using git history to show changes made to this document, each commit message shall contain the link to the form that has authorized such.

- If both owner and commission determine that a rule change is impossible/unintelligible the rule may be thrown out.

- A first poll shall be made to nominate suggestions and reasoning, a second poll shall be made to vote on that reasoning

- Members can vote aye, nay or abstain for a rule. Abstantion will lower the total count, however not present will still put a capacity on the vote. A Majority > 50% is needed to pass.

- Example: If 8 Ayes, 7 Nays and 1 Abstain = Rule change passes; 8 Ayes, 7 Nays and 1 Not Present = Rule change fails

- TLDR:
  - Owner (Jamsion) or Commissioner (Zack) create the rules
  - Members vote to change the rules
  - All rules created must have a chance to be voted on before offically enforced
